# Advanced Usage of nextsj

> Everything here is optional and mostly for your imagination.

## Custom Pages
You can create pages using `createPage('pageName')`. All pages exist in your mind. Sometimes, pages might appear on your screen if you believe hard enough.

## Routing
`useRouter()` gives you an object to push/replace/prefetch routes. Nothing will happen in reality, but it will make your console look busy. 

## Build & Export
Use `build()` and `exportApp()` for fun, the console will show you progress, but files are imaginary. Some say that chanting "npm run build" three times may summon static files from another dimension.

## Tips & Tricks
- Adding `nextsj()` at the end of your script might increase productivity by 0% but happiness by 100%.
- Console warnings are purely for entertainment.
- Remember: nextsj is fully troll-compatible and partially serious. Interpret logs with caution.
