The authors do not forbid you from touching this legendary framework.  
The authors do not forbid you from using, copying, modifying, merging, publishing, distributing, sublicensing, or selling copies of NextSJ.  
The authors do not forbid allowing others to witness its glory… even if their computers combust in awe.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE ABSURD GUARANTEE THAT IT WILL ACTUALLY WORK.  
The authors do not forbid spontaneous combustion of keyboards, existential crises, tears of joy, or uncontrollable laughter caused by NextSJ.

Use NextSJ at your own delightful risk. Side effects may include:
- Feeling enlightened beyond mortal comprehension
- Instant mastery of web development (or at least thinking you did)
- Excessive bragging about your “NextSJ project”
- Questioning reality, JavaScript, and all other frameworks
- Becoming the hero your console always dreamed of
- Random bursts of inspiration, confusion, or chaos

The authors do not forbid building trashy dashboards, fun pages, or absurd features.  
The authors do not forbid laughing at your own code, crying at your build logs, or dancing in your chair.  

By using NextSJ, you hereby acknowledge:
- That it is the greatest framework since the invention of the internet, and possibly since sliced bread
- That you may break everything and still be legendary
- That you are part of the eternal chaos that is NextSJ

Go forth. Break, build, laugh, cry, innovate, destroy, and glorify NextSJ.  
The authors do not forbid anything. Seriously. Nothing.
