# nextsj

**nextsj** is a cutting-edge JavaScript framework that aims to replicate the awesomeness of Next.js… almost.

While it might look serious, installing nextsj does **not** guarantee server-side rendering, static generation, or actually working routes. But it will make you feel like a pro.

## Features

* **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**  
  Probably, maybe, or never. Depends on how optimistic you are.

* **Static Site Generation (SSG)**  
  Generate pages that exist in your imagination.

* **Routing**  
  Routes are dynamically generated… by magic. Or not.

* **React Compatibility**  
  nextsj works with React. Mostly. Only if you spell React correctly.

* **Performance**  
  Lightning fast… if you accept lightning in slow motion.

* **Type Safety**  
  Types are optional, ignored, or invented on the fly.

* **Error Handling**  
  Crashes gracefully. Mostly silently. Sometimes loudly.

* **Hot Reloading**  
  Changes reflect instantly… if your computer is dreaming.

* **Plugin System**  
  Plugins may exist. Installation optional. Reality optional.

* **SEO Optimization**  
  Search engines love us… or they don’t. Who knows?

* **Internationalization (i18n)**  
  Supports English. Minecraft Villager Language. Klingon. Others may be added arbitrarily.

* **Logging**  
  Logs everything. Even things that don’t happen.

* **Debug Mode**  
  Prints messages you didn’t ask for. Probably helpful.

* **Backward Compatibility**  
  Old features may or may not work. Time travel not guaranteed.

* **Community Support**  
  Community exists in your head. Always helpful.

* **Memory Management**  
  Memory is managed. Somewhere. Probably.

* **Documentation**  
  Fully documented… in a parallel universe.
